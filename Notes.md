Please create a beautifully designed UI using Next.js, tailwindcss, typescript, and shadcn. It should allow a user to chat with a chat assistant which in turn incrementally generates a document that is visualized while the user is chating. We need to really think through the ideal way to do this so that we maintain the focus of the user but also give a sense of instant gratification as the document is generated.

This is in the right direction but we need to take the design to the next level. This needs to be very impressive and super satisfying to use

Again, in the right direction but this need to be at the level that it will win design awards based on its stunning user interface.

Can you simulate the comments that 3 team members may provide based on the conversation we are having? One should be helping with the sales strategy, one should be offering guidance on how to improve the writing or content and the other should be a general coach helping to oversee the whole effort.  Lets focus this on writing a Sales Proposal for a client who wants to purchase office furniture. Can you provide the comments by the coaches in JSON using the following format? {"comments": [{"role": "Sales Strategy Specialist","name": "Jamie","comment": "Consider... I will respond to let you know what advice I will or will not be taking.

Please create a beautifully designed UI using Next.js, tailwindcss, typescript, and shadcn. Strive for an award winning design for a Kanban Board using transitions at the level that it evokes a flow state in the user. Use shadcn ui components with drag and drop functionality and think about how the use of this product can result in dopamine production and truely game changing motivation for the user.  Allow the user to create a kanban board and add tasks to it. The KanbanBoard component should have the following features:

1. Add a kanban board
2. Rename a kanban board
3. Delete a kanban board
4. Add a new task to the board
5. Drag and drop tasks between columns
6. Delete a task from the board
7. Edit a task
8. Move a task to the next column
9. Move a task to the previous column
10. Move a task to the top of the column
11. Move a task to the bottom of the column

When a task is selected we can display a shadcn sheet to view the task details.

Take another look at the speed of the dots based on where they are.  It would be a smoother affect if the velocity started out slower.  This is in the right direction but we need to take the design to the next level. This needs to be very impressive and super satisfying to use.  Take a step back and analyze the transition.  Deliver a design that is truley awe inspiring!  I know you can do it!
------------------------
Great job!  We are getting closer.  Lets adjust the transition and animation timing so that the components are moving in concert with one another.  Think about when one object should start moving, when it should stop moving and how the speed and path of its movement should change over time.  We dont want the experience to be too busy for the user.  Be considerate about where the user's attention will be during the transition.  The experience should allow the user to passively take in the experience. We want to deliver a relaxing transition that culminates in a pop of joy.
